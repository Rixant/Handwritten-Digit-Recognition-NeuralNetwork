# Handwritten Digit Recognition
It is a simple neural network model built from the scratch to predict the handwritten digit from its image pixels.
The Neural Network model is prepared using 784 input nodes and 3 layers with 128 nodes in first layer,64 nodes in second layer, and 10 nodes in output layer.
It uses the train and test datasets published by MNIST and downloaded from Kaggle (url : https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data ).
